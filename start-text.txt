# Markdown?!

This file is both a text file, and a markdown file.

Markdown is a simple set of formatting instructions that let you add formatting to a text file. Markdown was developed by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz, and the specification is still on John Gruber's website: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

GitHub supports an extended set of markdown, and has an intoductory guide here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

You can use markdown in many of the text fields on GitHub to add extra formatting to your text:
* Gists
* Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
* Files with the `.md` or `.markdown extension`

and the GitHub preview will apply the markdown formating.
